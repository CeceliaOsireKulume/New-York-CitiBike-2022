    "## Concatenating is the best way because of the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity and Readability\n",
    "The pd.concat() method is easy to use and straightforward to implement. It allows you to concatenate multiple DataFrames along a particular axis (rows or columns), which is ideal for stacking files with similar structures (same columns).\n",
    "It only requires a list of DataFrames (or iterable objects) and automatically handles the concatenation.\n",
    "2. Handling Multiple Files Efficiently\n",
    "pd.concat() can handle an arbitrary number of CSV files. If you have many files (as is often the case in datasets like logs or time series), the method can quickly process and join them all into a single DataFrame, which is much more efficient than manually iterating over them and joining them piece by piece.\n",
    "3. Concatenation Along the Right Axis\n",
    "When concatenating CSV files, typically you want to join them along the rows (axis=0), which is the default behavior of pd.concat(). This is because you are likely appending more records (rows) to an existing structure, not adding more columns. This is commonly the case when dealing with large time-series or event log datasets where each file represents a time slice or different segment of data.\n",
    "4. Handling Inconsistent Indices\n",
    "By specifying ignore_index=True, pd.concat() automatically resets the indices of the resulting DataFrame. This prevents any issues with duplicated indices from different files and ensures that the final DataFrame has a consistent, sequential index.\n",
    "5. Memory Efficient\n",
    "pd.concat() works by efficiently combining DataFrames into one without having to create a large intermediate structure. It is especially useful when dealing with large datasets or multiple files, as it can be optimized to handle large amounts of data sequentially, minimizing memory consumption."
