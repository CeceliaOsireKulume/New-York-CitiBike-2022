# New-York-CitiBike-2022

For this project, we will be using public data from New York bike-sharing facilities operated by Citi
Bike. For context, Citi Bike’s popularity has increased since its launch in 2013. 

The company’s marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of
transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York
residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to
distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked
bikes, making it difficult to return a hired bike—and customer complaints.
